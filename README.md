# analytical-resonance-widths
notebooks to calculate estimated mean motion resonance widths and plot them for planetary systems

To generate a plot of resonances, use plot-system-resonances.ipynb as an example

Caveats: the resonance widths for each planet are calculated in the single planet + test particle limit
(see "Solar System Dynamics" by Murray and Dermott for equations and derivations: https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999ssd..book.....M/abstract), 
so they should only be considered as estimates of when planet-planet resonances might be important!
